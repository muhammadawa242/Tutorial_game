# Tutorial_game
A 2D game using python's pygame module

I think that the best technique to learn a new skill is deliberate practice. So, I followed a tutorial on youtube to make this particular game 
and I have already learnt a lot of things through this video about pygame. I intend to practice writing code for this game again and again and try to change it until I get familiarized with the new syntax and usage of this modules functions and methods.

Once I get comfortable with it, I will start developing a 2D snake game on my own.
